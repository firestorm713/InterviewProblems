# Interview Problems

This is a list of interview problems and questions, cribbed from Cracking the Coding Interview. A lot of my notes are going to be shorthand, and are not going to contain the full text of the questions from the book. [I highly recommend you buy it,](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/) because it's a great resource for learning both hard and soft interview skills.

The main reason I'm putting it up on GitHub is so I can pull and work on it wherever, though. This is primarily meant for personal use (although I may toss some other general c++ interview questions on here, too).
